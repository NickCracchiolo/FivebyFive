# FivebyFive
My second iOS app. Five by Five is a Puzzle/Math game built using Swift and SpriteKit.

A 5x5 grid is made with each tile having a number 1 through 5 or a bomb. 
The sides of the grid show the number of bombs in the adjacent row or column as well as the tiles sums for each row and column.

The objective is to flip all of the non bomb tiles each level. If you flip a bomb, game over. FOr each increasing level, the chances of a bomb tile go up.

Get to the highest level possible!
